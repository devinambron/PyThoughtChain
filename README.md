- Generates a detailed thought process, including consideration of opposing viewpoints and potential counterarguments.
- Provides a confidence score for the generated thought process.
- Displays a mind map visualization of the thought process.
- Allows users to provide feedback and refine the thought process iteratively.
- Generates a final answer based on the accumulated thought process and evaluation criteria.
